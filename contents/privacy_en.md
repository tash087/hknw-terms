## Article 7: End User Rights

### 7.1 Data Deletion Requests

If an End User wishes to have their own access logs deleted, we will respond as follows:

- **Feasibility**: In principle, since **individuals cannot be identified**, we cannot identify and delete specific accesses.
- **Alternative Measure**: If you wish to reset statistics for a specific shortened URL entirely, please contact us at abuse@hknw.link. However, we may decline such requests at our discretion.

### 7.2 Registered User Data Deletion

If a Registered User wishes to delete their account and associated data, please contact us at abuse@hknw.link. We will delete data associated with that email address within a reasonable period.

### 7.3 Opt-Out (Refusal of Collection)

If End Users do not wish to have statistical information collected:

- **Method**: Even if you enable your browser's "Do Not Track" setting, the Service **does not recognize** this signal (technically not supported).
- **Alternative Method**: Do not click on shortened URLs, or use an ad blocker (though this may result in incomplete statistics).
